# Web Dev 101: Introduction to web development.
This course is the initial phase in a profound understanding of web
technologies and the unlimited exploration thereof. With several years
of experience, I still find myself wondering about the vast plains of
old, new and upcoming code and their capabilities. My goal is not to teach
you every piece of technology out there but to help you become acquainted 
with the terrain; sharing with you the tools and skills that have helped 
me journey into the unknown. A modern day Lewis and Clark exploration--you don't know 
what lies ahead but you will have the tools and skills to succeed.

My name is Bryant Ruelas and welcome to Web Dev 101. I hope you enjoy this
course and find the passion, love, and excitement that I've found since 
my introduction to the web. The style of teaching I will implement will shift 
away from the typical, "I teach you read" to a "let's build something" kind of style. 

Because you can easily find book knowledge and literature on any given 
code--pretty much anywhere--we will take more of a "hands-on" approach 
and make something a little more tangible. Still, I encourage you to pick 
up a book, read an article or watch online tutorials for your general knowledge.
We will create user interfaces to edify your understanding of the web 
in practical real-world examples. If some portions of the lesson become difficult 
or confusing, I encourage you to keep going.

*Note: My experience with computers in regards to web development and design
has been incubated on the Mac OS ecosystem. However, I grew up on windows
and the OS still runs somewhere in my cognitive circuitry. Please bear with me as I
try to foster a learning environment that works for both types of users.*
